Apollo's Initial Proposal

"Tic-Tac-Toe"

This program will allow two players to play tic-tac-toe without the need for pen and paper. 
One person will select where they would place their mark on the grid. 
Then the second person would place their mark on their selected place on the grid. 
This would continue until all the spaces on the grid are filled. 
If there are 3 matching marks lined up together (vertically, diagonally, or horizontally), the code will output that mark as the winner. 
If the grid is filled without 3 matching marks, the code will output a draw. 
If the user tries to input their mark on an already filled spot on the grid, the code will reject it and the user has to try again.

List of features:
- An option to select which character to play as, featuring the three chipmunks and a secret character.
- A functioning tic-tac-toe board.
- Change markers acccording to character.
